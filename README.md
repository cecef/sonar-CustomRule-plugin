<h1>Custom SonarQube Java plugin API development</h1>

<h2>Designed for API:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sonar 4.5.1</li>
<li>java plugin 2.9.1</li>
<li>Maven 2.X</li>
</ul>

Usage of Sonar 4.5.1 with maven.


<h2>Basic knowledge for Java plugin API development/deployment</h2>

<ul>
<li>Create a class implementing RulesDefinition -> it is a ServerExtension whose sole purpose is to make your custom 
rules appear in SonarQube's UI if you've explicitly provided a definition (programatically, or in a XML file, or through annotations).
This extension is loaded at server startup.</li>
<li>Create a class implementing BatchExtension and JavaFileScannersFactory -> its purpose is to make all your custom 
java rules available during batch analysis by returning instances of your rules. This extension is loaded during analysis.</li>
<li>Create a class extending SonarPlugin which returns Extensions created in points 1 and 2 above.</li>
<div>Your custom rules will then be both available in UI and during analysis. 
If you don't do 1. you won't be able to activate / configure them. 
If you forget 2, they will be activable / configurable, but will never be executed (and no error will be raised neither)
</div>

<h2>API development FUTURE</h2>
<h3>BaseTreeVisitor</h3>
The way to write custom checks for Java as of today is to use the <strong>BaseTreeVisitor</strong>. 
All the other ways are now deprecated and Sonar group is working to be able to remove them 
(but it is not always straightforward as some of them requires a complete semantic analysis to be removed).
<br/><br/>
BaseTreeVisitor does not use SSLR directly, the java plugin is not moving away from SSLR rather from one class, 
specifically ASTNode, in order to work on a SyntaxTree with a class specific for each type of node, 
The drop of Xpath checks occurs in that logic of moving away from a non-typed SyntaxTree
